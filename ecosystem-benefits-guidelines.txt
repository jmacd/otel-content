This talk will cover several observations that helped us organize a
large community to create a complex new specification with many
stakeholders.

Early in the OpenTelemetry project we discovered something
philosophers of science have known for a while: the problem of
"incommensurability".  We were literally talking past each other
because half of the community came from OpenTracing and the other half
from OpenCensus.  Our words did not mean the same things, the
requirements of each side were could not be understood by the other.
We found that code examples and prototypes conveyed meaning more
effectively, until a shared understanding emerged.

As the project gained contributors, we had to decentralize control
over the various parts and grant maintainership to a select number of
individuals tasked with growing a community in each language.  Despite
adding approvers as each community grew, dedicated roles for triage of
issues and PRs were needed.  To keep the project moving forward,
several dedicated project managers were assigned to keep us on track.

Github issues and PR discussions proved an ineffective way to discuss
large, complex changes or additions to the specification.  We
developed an RFC process for proposing and approving such changes, so
they could be reviewed in small units before they were written into
the specification..
