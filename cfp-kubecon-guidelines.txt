System design is hard, and writing a precise specificaiton is even
harder. OpenTelemetry is a large, cross-language project, with APIs in
over nine languages. Come learn what worked for us, and what didn't.

Shared understanding is difficult to achieve when it is built on
imprecise language (english) or conflicting terminology taken from
past designs and systems. Too much process dampens interest, too
little creates risk. What are effective ways to confront these issues?

Over the past year, we've come together as a community, and developed
a specification process which allows us to mobilize many teams to work
in parallel. Even if you aren't creating a huge new OSS project, the
tools and processes described in this talk can be adapted to improve
system design, and make collaboration fruitful across your
organization.
